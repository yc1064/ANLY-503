    "This assignment is about understanding the ECO dataset and using it to create interactive and animated visualizations that help explore and analyze household electricity consumption and appliance-level consumption patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Electricity Consumption and Occupancy (ECO) dataset contains power consumption data for three households at both the overall household level (smart meters) and the appliance level (plugs). The dataset covers various appliances like fridge, freezer, microwave, coffee machine, kettle, stereo, laptop, entertainment systems, and other devices. The smart meter data contains 16 columns with various power-related measurements, while the plug data provides appliance-level consumption. The data is organized into daily CSV files spanning from June 27, 2012, to January 31, 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most relevant portions of the dataset for our questions will be the 'powerallphases' variable from the smart meter data, which represents the total power consumed over all power phases in the household, and the plug data, which will help us analyze individual appliance consumption patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data-science Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "+ How does the overall power consumption of a household vary over time, and can we identify any patterns or trends in the data (e.g., daily or weekly cycles, seasonal variations)?  \n",
    "Visualization 1 will display a time-series plot of the overall power consumption for each household. This visualization will help us identify any patterns or trends in the data and enable users to interactively explore consumption over different time frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ What is the contribution of each appliance to the total power consumption of a household? Can we identify any high-consumption appliances that could be targeted for energy efficiency improvements?  \n",
    "Visualization 2 will display a stacked bar chart or pie chart showing the proportion of total power consumption attributed to each appliance for each household. This visualization will help us understand the contribution of each appliance to the overall consumption and identify high-consumption appliances for potential energy efficiency improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating these visualizations, we aim to understand the patterns of household electricity consumption and the role of individual appliances in overall power usage. The interactive nature of the visualizations will allow users to explore the data and gain insights that could be used to inform energy-saving strategies or policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data preparation and EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll prepare the data for analysis and create some initial exploratory visualizations. First, we need to load and preprocess the data by combining daily CSV files, converting units, and aggregating the data as required. Then, we'll perform some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and inform our later visualizations. The whole implementation can be divided into the following steps:\n",

    "\n",
    "+ Visual Encodings: We chose line charts to represent overall power consumption over time for each household because they are an intuitive and effective way to show trends and patterns in time series data. For the second visualization, we could use a stacked bar chart or a heatmap to display the distribution of power consumption among different appliances. These chart types can clearly show the proportion of power consumed by each appliance and make it easy to compare between households.Alternatives we considered include scatter plots and area charts. Scatter plots could reveal more details about the data points, but they might be less effective in communicating trends in the data. Area charts can also show trends over time, but they can be harder to interpret when comparing multiple datasets.\n",
    "+ Interaction: For interactivity, we plan to use dropdown menus or sliders to allow users to switch between different households or select a specific time range for analysis. This will enable users to compare power consumption patterns between households or zoom in on specific periods of interest.An alternative to dropdown menus or sliders is providing clickable legends or other on-chart elements that allow users to interact with the data. However, dropdown menus and sliders provide a more consistent and accessible way for users to control the visualization's display.\n",
    "+ Animation: Animation can be helpful for showing changes in data over time or highlighting specific patterns in the data. For example, we could use animation to show the progression of power consumption throughout a day or to highlight peak consumption periods.An alternative to animation is to provide static visualizations that focus on specific time periods or patterns. However, animation can make the data more engaging and help users better understand the trends.\n",
